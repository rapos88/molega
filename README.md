# MOLEGA: Modeling Language for Educational Card Games

This repo contains both the application software, and evaluation experiment for the MOLEGA project.

## application folder

This folder contains the developed application, including a landing page, the MOLEGA editor/environment, and some sample output games (note: these require node.js setup to run on your own server).

## evaluation folder

This folder contains our evaluation experiments. This includes:

 - an `inputModels` folder than contains all of the input models used to generate the games
 - a `modelImages` folder that contains exported images of the input models
 - an `actualZips` folder that contains the actual zip-file outputs generated by the MOLEGA environment
 - an `expected` folder that contains the expected outputs for each of the test cases (manually created)
 - a `diff.sh` script that automatically compares the actual and expected outputs for each test, reporting any differences.
 - a `Mapping.xlsx` file that maps test case names to their coded names

The test cases in the evaluation dataset use coded names. To identify which coded names match to which test cases from our paper, refer to the `Mapping.xlsx` file.
