# MOLEGA: Modeling Language for Educational Card Games

This repo contains both the application software, and evaluation experiment for the MOLEGA project.

## application folder

This folder contains the developed application, including a landing page, the MOLEGA editor/environment, and some sample output games (note: these require node.js setup to run on your own server).

## evaluation folder

This folder contains our evaluation experiments. This includes:

 - a set of input models that provide coverage of all functionality
 - for each model, a set of expected output files, manually created
 - for each model, the automatically generated code, generated by the MOLEGA environment
 - a python script which performs an automated validation to confirm the generated outputs match the expected outputs.
